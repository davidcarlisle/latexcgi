# Security Policy
## Reporting a Vulnerability
Security vulnerabilities can be reported privately _via_ GitHub at
https://github.com/davidcarlise/latexcgi/security. Using this mechanism means that
the potential issue does not show in the public issues list, and will 
chance to review the report before it is made public.
