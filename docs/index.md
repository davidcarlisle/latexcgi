# The TeXLive.net Server

## Introduction

The TeXLive.net server (formally known as (LaTeX CGI server)
(currently running at [texlive.net](https://texlive.net)) accepts
LaTeX documents via an HTTP POST request and returns a PDF document or
log file in the case of error.

It is written as a perl script accepting the post requests via cgi-bin access in an apache HTTP server.

## HTTP Requests

The document must be supplied by an HTTP POST multipart/form-data request.
Any other HTTP request is rejected. The allowed form fields are defined below.
If the form contains unexpected fields, the whole submission is rejected.

### Form Fields

 * engine
 
   This field is optional, but if supplied must be one of  
   `lualatex`, `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, `uplatex`, `platex`, `latex`,  
   `lualatex-dev`, `pdflatex-dev`, `xelatex-dev`, `uplatex-dev`, `platex-dev`, `latex-dev`,  
   `luatex`, `pdftex`, `xetex`, `uptex`, `ptex`, `tex`,  
   `context`.
   
   The default is `pdflatex`.
 * bibcmd
 
   This field is optional, but if supplied must be one of  
   `biber`, `bibtex`, `pbibtex`, `bibtex8`.
   
   It defaults to empty unless the log of the first run from LaTeX has
   a biblatex message saying
   to run biber or bibtex, or if there is a `No file document.bbl` message.
 * filename[]
 
   There must be at least one of these parameters, each specifying a filename.
   There must be one `filename[]` parameter with value `document.tex`
 * filecontents[]
 
   These multi-line fields contain the contents of the supplied files.
   There must be the same number of `filecontents[]` parameters as `filename[]` parameters.

 * return

   This field is optional but if supplied must be one or `pdfjs`, `pdf`, `log` or `make4ht`, `LaTeXML` or `lwarp`.

   The default is `pdfjs` meaning the PDF.js is used to render the PDF.

   `pdf` specifies that the PDF document should be returned, so will use your browser's default PDF renderer.

   `log` specifies that the log file should be returned even in non-error cases.
   
    `make4ht` specifies that make4ht will be used and HTML
    returned. If the `engine` is specified as `xelatex` or `lualatex`
    than the `-x` or `-l` arguments respectively are passed to
    `make4ht` so that it uses an appropriate TeX engine.
   
    `LaTeXML` specifies HTML to be generated by LaTeXML (the egine parameter os ignored in this case).
	
	`lwarp` specifies that HTML is to be generated by `lwarpmk` after generating PDF with the specified engine.
	
 * makeindex[]
 
   This field is optional and may be used multiple times.

   The value must be of the form `makindex` _options_

   `options` gives the options for `makeindex` for the document
   `document.tex`
   it is currently restricted to `-` and `.` and ASCII letters and digits.




## The learnlatex Comment Interface (runlatex.js)
Usually the form for the HTTP submission is generated by the  `runlatex`  JavaScript,
[runlatex.js](runlatex.js),
jointly maintained at the [learnlatex Github](https://github.com/learnlatex/learnlatex.github.io/blob/main/assets/scripts/runlatex.js). 

This constructs the parameters from one or more HTML `<pre>` elements, which may be controlled using comments of the form
```
% !TEX  ... keyword
```

The comments are checked in a case insensitive way, any text other than the final keyword is ignored, so the following are all equivalent
```
% !TEX lualatex
%  !TeX  program = LuaLaTeX
% !tex  ignored comment lualatex
```

The known keywords are

* `lualatex`, `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, `uplatex`, `platex`, `latex`,
  `lualatex-dev`, `pdflatex-dev`, `xelatex-dev`, `uplatex-dev`,
  `platex-dev`, `latex-dev`, `luatex`, `pdftex`, `xetex`,
  `uptex`, `ptex`, `tex`, `context`.

   The `engine` parameter is set to the specified keyword (lowercased).
 
   If this is not used then `engine` is set to `pdflatex`.
 
* `biber`, `bibtex`, `pbibtex`, `bibtex8`
 
   The `bibcmd` parameter is set to the specified keyword (lowercased).
  
   If this is not used the `bibcmd` parameter is not set and bibtex or biber may be chosen automatically as described above.

* `pdfjs`, `pdf`, `log`, `make4ht`, `latexml`, `lwarp`.

   The `return` parameter is set to the specfied keyword (lowercased).

   If this is not used, the `return` parameter is not set and the
   server will use PDF.js for PDF display, as described above.
  
*  `makeindex` _options_
 
   There may be any number of `% !TEX makeindex` comments, the options
   are passed to the LaTeX CGI server `makeindex[]` parameters
   described above.

   See <a href="test#makeindex">the makeindex example in the test document</a>.
 
 
### No Edit Option

If an HTML `<pre>` element has the CSS `noedit`
class then it is not processed by this JavaScript and the original
`<pre>` is displayed. (In GitHub pages  the markup `{: .noedit :}`
may be placed after the code block to add this class.) 

### No TeX compilation

If an HTML `<pre>` element has the CSS `norun` class
the buttons to submit the example is not added.

By default, when `adddefaultpreamble` parameter is false
if the code block does not contain either `\documentclass` or a `%
!TEX` comment that specifies a TeX engine, no buttons are added to
submit the document to an online TeX system.

If the `adddefaultpreamble` parameter is true, then the buttons are
added if the example has more than `minrunlines`, and the first line
starts with `%` or contains a `\ `. 

### Multifile Projects.

Normally just the file corresponding to a single code block is
submitted but the page may contain a javascript `preincludes` array
that specifies a mapping of code blocks to filenames to control a
multi-file submission to either texlive.net or Overleaf.

See [LearnLaTeX lesson 13](https://www.learnlatex.org/en/lesson-13).


## runlatex Parameters

A page loading `runlatex.js` can set several parameters as fields in
the `runlatex` configuration. Many of these parameters were added
to allow customisation for use in forums such as [latex.org](https://latex.org/) or
[texwelt.de](https://texwelt.de/) managed by Stefan Kottwitz. Unlike the situation with
curated examples in a tutorial such as learnlatex, forums often have
incomplete or erroneous examples, and a slightly different interaction
is required.


### The `runlatex` configuration object.

* `runlatex.texts`

   An array of strings allowing site customisation and localisation.
   
   ```
   runlatex.texts ={
    "Open in Overleaf": "Overleaf button text",
    "TeXLive.net":      "texlive.net button text",
    "Delete Output":    "Delete Outpu button textt",
    "Compiling PDF":    "Compiling PDF span notiocation of submission",
    // The following not used on learnlatex.org
    "edit":             "edit button text",
    "copy":             "copy button text",
    "Added Code":       "Added code comment added to inserted code",
    "End Added Code":   "End Added code comment added to inserted code",
    "Top Caption":      "inline HTML caption added above the example:"
     }
	 ```

* `runlatex.editorlines=100;`

   The number of lines in the Editor.
   
*  `runlatex.adddefaultpreamble=false;`

    If set true, a default preamble (using packages based on the
	content fo the fragment) will be inserted if the document has no
	`\documentclass`
	
* `runlatex.adddefaultengine=false;`

   By default, runlatex will submit the example as `pdflatex` unless
   there is a `% !TeX luatex` or similar comment. If this is set true
   then the default engine is chosen based on commands or packages
   used in the content.
   

  If neither `\documentclass` nor a `% !TeX` engine comment appears in
  the example then a default preamble is constructed (based on the
  commands seen in the example) and added to the code block via the
  ACE editor interface.  This preamble may not be completely correct
  as needed to run the example but is a good "first guess" and will
  save typing boiler plate preambles in the online forum editor. If
  the preamble is edited and re-submitted to the texlive.net server,
  the boiler plate preamble is not re-added.
   
* `runlatex.usecaptions=false;`

   If this is true, and `runlatex.texts['Top Caption']` is non empty
   the caption will be inserted above each example.


* `runlatex.minrunlines=0;`

   If `adddefaultpreamble` is true, interaction is not added if there
   are fewer than this number of lines. So for example setting this to
   3 avoids adding a run latex button on 1 or 2 line fragments.

* `rulatex.usecookies=true;`

   The `runlatex.js` never sets any cookies but provides some helper
   functions that may be used by hosting sites to set user
   preferences. By default these cookies will be read if set to set
   default return mechanims, default text engine and the theme used by
   the ACE editor. If this option is set to false the functions just
   return empty and no cookies will be accesed at all.
   [See the next section](#setting-default-parameters-via-cookies)
   
* `runlatex.completionsURI=""`

   If this parameter is set to a non empty string, it is used as a URI to a JSON
   file that gives completion data for completing commands in the editor.
   See [this example](https://davidcarlisle.github.io/latexcgi/latexcmds.json)
   to see the format required. If it is an empty string then command completion
   is not enabled in the editor.
   
   Curently if this parameter is used you also need to load the ACE extension

   `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ace/1.4.12/ext-language_tools.js"></script>`
   
   (Perhaps runlatex.js should add this automatically when needed).
  
### Setting default parameters via cookies.

By default no information is stored in cookies or other local storage
and so each submission is controlled just by the comments in the code
to be submitted. It is however possible to save alternative default
values for the engine, return and ACE theme from their initial values of
`pdfjs`, `pdflatex` and `textmate`.

A sample form to set these cookies
is available [on this site](settings).

Note that the cookies are
browser and site specific so a value set on this site will not affect
another site using the same code.

If site maintainers using copies of
`runlatex.js` wish to use the cookie settings they may want to adjust
the setting form. In particular, if your site already has a global
cookie acceptance mechanism, you may want to not have the
accept/delete buttons and instead enable the options automatically if
the user has already accepted cookies for your site.

## Code blocks without TeX submission

* Two special `!TEX` comments may be used, which must be on the first
  line. The comment marker for these does not need to be `%` it can be
  any combination of `%`, `#`, `/`, `*`.

    - `!TEX noedit` causes the div to be left unchanged.
	    (equivalently class=`noedit` on the `<pre>` element).
    - `!TEX none` causes the editor to be used in Text mode, and no
      texlive.net button is added.
     (equivalently class=`norun` on the `<pre>` element).
	  
  If the the first non-white line does not start with `%` and does not
  contain a `\ ` then the no-compile, `none` mode is assumed, so that
  log files, shell scripts etc may be inserted without being
  interpreted as LaTeX.
  


## Processing Pipeline

1. Assuming the form fields are all validated, the supplied files are unpacked into a new temporary directory.
2. LaTeX is run on `document.tex` (using whichever engine is specified by engine parameter).
3. If there was an error, the log is returned and processing stops.
4. The log is searched for requests to run biber or bibtex, or to rerun latex.
5. If no "rerun" messages were found, the PDF is returned and processing stops.
6. If bibtex or biber is detected the relevant command as explicitly or implicitly specified in the bibcmd parameter is run.
7. If an error occurs in bibtex/biber, a log is returned (Currently this just has the exit status).
8. If any `makeindex[]` calls are specified these are run, if the previous command gave no error.
9. LaTeX is run twice more, checking for error after each run.
10. For pLaTeX variants `dvipdfmx` is called to generate PDF. For latex, `dvips` and `ps2pdf` are called to generate PDF.
11. The PDF or error log (or for HTML returns, the output directory) is moved, and the temporary directory is deleted.
12. A PDF (or for HTML return options the top level HTML file) is returned, or the log file in case of error (or log requested).


Each system call is guarded by a timeout so "Error" in the above
stages may be that the command was taking too long rather than an
actual error. There are also restrictions on input paths for security
reasons, attempting to input files out of the allowed area will result
in `input error` being returned as the log, neither the TeX log nor the
generated PDF will be returned.

The PDF document is not directly returned, the site hosts an instance
of [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js) and returns
`PDF.js?file=document-xxxxx.pdf` primarily to ensure rendering in
mobile clients that often do not include a PDF renderer by default.
