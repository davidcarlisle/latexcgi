# make4ht configurations and tests

See these examples [tested online at texlive.net](https://davidcarlisle.github.io/latexcgi/test2-make4ht.html)


at [learnlatex.org](https://learnlatex.org) the examples are run with a fixed commandline

`make4ht -d output [-x|-l] document.tex "learnlatex4ht,2,mathjax"`

where `-x` or `-l` is just used if the example has `% !TeX lualatex` or `% !TeX xelatex` respectively.
